# MountShare  
```
OVERVIEW: Mount network shares the way "Connect to Serverâ€¦" does

The default usage assumes the needed credentials are in the user's keychain or the server uses Kerberos.
Otherwise, a username and password can be passed in, or the system can prompt for authentication with a GUI window.
The various mounting and opening options are available as command line flags.
This command should be run as the user that is mounting the share.

USAGE: mountshare [<options>] <server-share-path>

ARGUMENTS:
  <server-share-path>     The full path to the share to mount i.e. "smb://server.domain.tld/share"

This project was inspired by [my previous use](https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/mounting-file-shares-based-on-ad-group-membership-using-enterprise-connect/) of [mount_shares_better.py](https://gist.github.com/pudquick/1362a8908be01e23041d).  Then I found useful information on Apple's [developer forums](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/94733) and a lot of help from a gist of [a library](https://gist.github.com/mosen/2ddf85824fbb5564aef527b60beb4669) to do the same things.
