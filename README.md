# MountShares  
```
OVERVIEW: Mount network shares the way "Connect to Serverâ€¦" does

The default usage assumes the needed credentials are in the user's keychain or the server uses Kerberos.
Otherwise, a username and password can be passed in, or the system can prompt for authentication with a GUI window.
The various mounting and opening options are available as command line flags.
This command should be run as the user that is mounting the share.
